# CurseforgeZipDownloader

This program downloads the mod files in the jar format from a Curseforge .zip modpack. The resulting "mods" folder can then be used in an external launcher.

## How To:

Download the latest release and unzip the folder. Put the Curseforge modpack (as a .zip file) into this folder and run the program. A "mods" folder should be created.
